Add compile-time validation for C++ vtable compatibility

Added validation in proc-macros to catch unsupported features at compile time:

- self by value (must use &self or &mut self)
- Generic methods (not supported in C++ vtables)
- Generic traits/impls (not supported in C++ vtables)
- async fn (not supported in C++ vtables)
- Non-FFI-safe types: String, Vec, Box, Rc, Arc, Result, references, slices, trait objects, impl Trait
- Methods without &self/&mut self (C++ vtables require a this pointer)

Each error includes a helpful message explaining what to use instead.
