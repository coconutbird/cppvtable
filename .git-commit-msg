Rename proc-macro attributes to avoid naming conflicts

Renamed attributes to be crate-namespaced:
- #[cpp_interface] -> #[cppvtable]
- #[implement(Interface)] -> #[cppvtable_impl(Interface)]

This avoids potential naming conflicts with other libraries
or future Microsoft naming conventions.

Updated all files:
- crates/cppvtable-macro/src/lib.rs (proc-macro definitions)
- crates/cppvtable/src/lib.rs (re-exports and docs)
- crates/cppvtable/src/decl.rs (declarative macro delegation and docs)
- src/main.rs (example code)
- crates/cppvtable/tests/*.rs (all test files)
- crates/cppvtable-cpp-tests/src/lib.rs (C++ interop tests)
